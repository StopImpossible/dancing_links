# dancing_links

I use the dancing links to solve the most difficult sudoku in the world with Python.

And then use the code to get the answer of the Kirkma's students problem.
The problem is: Kirkma has fifteen girl students, every of whom prefers to going for a walk after dinner with other two persons. Whether they can go for a walk with each other only once in a week? A student should take a walk with other two students everyday, then in a week can take a walk with other 14 students. It seems have the solution.
